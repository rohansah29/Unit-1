Today I am going to share with you about my first two weeks at Masai School. Believe me this is the true feedback, initially when I had thought to join Masai School at that time I had so many doubts like actually Masai school existing or not?But,According to me about 70% of my doubts got resolved in the first two weeks at Masai school. Initially they have two days of induction in which you will get a whole idea about Masai school like about the course and other doubts, later on 3-4 days you will learn about basics of coding and power skills and most important thing that builds your mindset towards learning these skills. From the second week you will get to know what is military style coding class? According to me, the overall experience of two weeks at Masai school is good.
